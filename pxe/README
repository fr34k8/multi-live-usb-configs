quick and dirty howto for custom booting, without syslinux : 
------------------------------------------------------------
ipxe can be written to a floppy or into network card rom. This of course negates use of syslinux or other bootloader.

In order to do this, you will need to embed config file into ipxe (or use a generic build and open config menu every netboot)

You will need: ipxe source tree , gcc, make and general development tools.


Grab the sources with 

  git clone git://git.ipxe.org/ipxe.git

change to ipxe/src , copy your ipxe menu inside as e.g. mymenufile , and run : 

  make EMBED=mymenufile  

This will produce ipxe images with the menu file already embedded. The bin/ipxe.dsk is for floppies, iso for cd, usb for pendrives.

You can generate a specific image with 

  make bin/ipxe.dsk EMBED=mymenufile

(replace for different image accordingly)


Some alterations to IPXE may be necessary if you are building it yourself

$EDITOR src/config/general.h

# change undef to define by those and uncomment ( // ) if necessary


# for sanboot
#define SANBOOT_PROTO_HTTP

# for fetching from https
#define DOWNLOAD_PROTO_HTTPS
